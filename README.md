# Battleships

This is a battleships game being created as part of the Testing JavaScript module in The Odin Project's JavaScript course.

The aim of this project is to learn and practice test-driven development (TDD). I feel comfortable enough coding a battleships game, so, personally, I am only planning to do enough to get a proper feel for TDD, and I probably won't spend time polishing the project; I may not even get around to creating a fully functioning UI.
